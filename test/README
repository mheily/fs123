Testing is tricky.

- We need a precheckin script that we can use for gating checkins.
  See ../precheckin

- We need a script that we can run in a devel tree that doesn't
  necessarily "clean" everything in sight before running the way
  ../precheckin does.  See ./runtests.

  runtests starts an fs123p7exportd server and a mount.fs123p7 client.

- We need the actual tests.  See ./t-* and tseq-*

All tests can and should assume that some environment variables
have been set (all of which are stored in c/runenv):

EXPORT_ROOT
MTPT

The t-* tests are assumed to be runnable in parallel.  I.e., they
shouldn't reconfigure the client or server.

On the other hand, the tseq-* test are not runnable in parallel.  They
may reconfigure the client or server, but they must put everything
back the way they found it when they are done.
